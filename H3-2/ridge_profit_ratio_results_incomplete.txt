Write in the out-of-sample results of runing the script again, using different myscorers.
We have already written in the out-of-sample results of using r2.
The out-of-sample results you need to obtain to do this are printed out in outputfile.txt

myscorer = None #uses the default r2 score, not recommended
Out-of-sample: CAGR=0.198768 Sharpe ratio=0.71448 Profit ratio=1.13575 maxDD=-0.0590802 maxDDD=436 Calmar ratio=3.36437

Suppose we want the out-of-sample Profit ratio to be as high as possible.
In that case, it makes sense to select myscorer as one based on the profit_ratio function.
However, there are other options.
myscorer based on information_coefficient (a statistical metric) results
in a high out-of-sample Profit ratio, whereas
a scorer based on r2 or neg_mean_absolute_error (two other statistical metrics) do not.
